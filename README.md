## Django Pizzeria

A Project made with Django of a fictional pizzeria, started from scratch. Also uses Bootstrap4 and Jquery. Database is SQLite.

Menu was made as per harvard's lecture assignment, to showcase code flexibility, not to be most ui consisent. 

Allows you to:

- register
- login
- add items to cart
- choose toppings for pizza if chosen pizza has toppings
- place an order
- view your past orders.

Most interactivity comes with adding pizza with toppings. Your shopping cart gets cached automatically.

Since most html uses django's template engine, if you add any new product instance to a database, it will get updated in html automatically.
